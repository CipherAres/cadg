# Session 1:  
The party met up with one of Esme's aides; an NHP by the name of Flux. They absolutely decimated the training/calibration exercise, and were presented with three possible assignments, of which they chose the job from the Harrier guild to head to Colony 6 and investigate what's gotten the fauna there riled up enough to roam closer to the settlement, causing a variety of issues, not least of which the destruction of an important food source in the form of local flora.

# Session 2:  
The party arrives in Colony 6. They gather information about the situation there, hone their skills, tinker about and make some connections. After intervening in an altercation between two mercenaries, they rendezvous with their contact, a Harrier guild member by the name of Gustav Howard. In all likelihood, the animals have been acting up to a disturbance at the top of the food chain caused by the arrival of a creature not native to the region, forcing other fauna to leave their old territory. After exchanging information and making some preparations, they return to their quarters to rest. Tomorrow, they'll head to the mountains northwest of Colony 6 to hunt down their quarry.

# Session 3:
The party began the hunt for their quarry, and manage to complete it successfully. The target's especially grotesque appearance suggests it was not native to this planet...


# Session 4: #
The party receives coordinates for their mission, leading them to the coast near Colony 4; when they arrive, they find a delapidated launch platform made for slinging mechanized chassis across the ocean for fast transport, as well as some sort of orb that looks like a "gap" in space akin to a black hole, and ships from both Smith Shimano Corpro and Harrison Armory being attacked by a swarm of strange creatures. A strange light appears on the surface of the orb, and the party launches towards it, fighting off the swarm and eventually making their way inside.
